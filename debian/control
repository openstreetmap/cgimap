Description: Development packages for CGImap, the C++ OpenStreetMap API
 Development files for developing applications or libraries against CGImap.

Package: libcgimap-apidb0
Section: contrib/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: libcgimap-core0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Library for connecting CGImap to an "apidb" schema database
 The "apidb" schema database is that used natively by the OpenStreetMap website
 code, and exported by Osmosis "apidb" functions.

Package: libcgimap-core0
Section: contrib/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Common code shared by CGImap components
 Includes code to work with bounding boxes, logging, output in XML and JSON
 formats.

Package: libcgimap-fcgi0
Section: contrib/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: libcgimap-core0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Library for exposing CGImap functionality via FCGI
 Connects CGImap via FCGI to a web server such as Apache.

Package: libcgimap-staticxml0
Section: contrib/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: libcgimap-core0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Library for serving XML files on disk via CGImap
 Used by CGImap for mock implementations of the database, but can also be
 useful for offline, stand-alone APIs.

Depends: libcgimap-core0 (= ${binary:Version}), libcgimap-apidb0 (= ${binary:Version}), libcgimap-fcgi0 (= ${binary:Version}), libcgimap-staticxml0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: CGImap is a C++ implementation of the OpenStreetMap API map call
 CGImap is a C++ implementation of some parts of the OpenStreetMap API as an
 FCGI process. The rails implementation of the "map" call had a few problems
 with memory - it uses a lot of it and there is a leak which makes it annoying
 to use in long-running environments, like the main OSM server.
 .
 CGImap attempts to address these memory problems and makes it easier to
 optimise the queries, something which is also a bit of a pain to do in Rails.
